# Day-Planner

## Desciption
Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Goals

This site is designed to display and store users schedules. The user can type in their daily events and have it in an organized layout. The page is divided into 3 sections:



* **Time** section - Each hour from 8am to 5pm is shown on the screen.
* **Text** section - To show and organize the events for that hour.
* **Save** section - To allow users to save their daily schedule on their local system.

## Complications

During the process of making this planner site, I did run into some problems: 

* Writing DRY code.
    * I spent a lot of time writing for loops to try and dynamically generate all elements of the page, including the text boxes, times, and save buttons. Ultimately I was unable to grab the elements I wanted to change, so I ended up writing out most things. If I do this assignment again, I would really like to figure out how to use the loops appropriately and make my code much more efficient.
* Local storage
    * I am still having a lot of trouble with saving data in the local storage and then getting it back when the page is refreshed. I also ran into this problem on the previous homework. Running through the in class activities has not seemed to help, so I am going to look for some other help.

## Credits and Thanks

Thank you to my wife, who endured sitting next to me as I cursed under my breath about for loops all evening.
